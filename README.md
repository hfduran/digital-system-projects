# Digital Systems

Repository dedicated for development of digital system projects.

For these projects, we make use of the following stack:
- VHDL langugage for hardware description code
- ghdl for simulation
- GTKWave for wave visualization and debugging
- Quartus Lite for circuit syntheses on FPGA

The main project of this repository is the creation of a **elevator system**, which implements the elevator algorithm in hardware, and has been implemented on a physical prototype!
